Data type is the classification of data into a category.
  
Alphanumeric characters are classified as STRINGS
Whole numbers are classified as INTEGERS
Numbers with decimal points are classified as FLOAT
True or false values are classified as BOOLEAN
A collection of similar types of elements are called ARRAY
